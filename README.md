# Indian Sign Language Recognition and Sentence Generation

This project aims to develop a robust system for recognizing and interpreting Indian Sign Language (ISL) gestures using advanced deep learning techniques. Leveraging Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and the Mediapipe library, the project will empower communication for individuals with hearing impairments by providing an efficient and accurate means of translating sign language into text or spoken language. By combining the power of LSTM networks and the convenience of the Mediapipe library, this project aims to create an effective and accessible tool for Indian Sign Language recognition, contributing to enhanced communication opportunities for the hearing-impaired community.
